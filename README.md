# Xbox-360-modding-guide
In this guide i will teach you how to mod you xbox 360 without chipping you console in terms of soldering opening the xbox and messing around with the motherboard in just 
Step 1. first we need to download xeunshacle [here](https://github.com/Byrom90/XeUnshackle/releases/tag/v1.03) which is at the time in beta and the version of the xe unschacle is 1.03
Step2. Download aurora [here](https://phoenix.xboxunity.net/#/news)
Step3. Download badupdate by grimdoomer,InvoxiPlayGames,kmx360 [here](https://github.com/grimdoomer/Xbox360BadUpdate) go to release and download the latest version which is currently 1.2
Step 5.Download rock band blitz trial [here](https://digiex.net/threads/rock-band-blitz-xbox-live-arcade-download-delisted-from-xbla.15780/)
Step 6.Download xexmenu this will help us run .xex files such as aurora you can download it [here](https://download.digiex.net/Consoles/Xbox360/Jtag/xexmenu_v1.1.rar)
Step 7.Get a USB (Preferably 64GB of storage if you plan storing games on it)
Step 8. Go to you PC format your USB as FAT32 then turn on your xbox plug the usb into the console go to settings>storage>your USB and then format.
Step 9. then plug your USB into your pc again open the Xbox360BadUpdate-Retail-USB-v1.2 folder go to rockband blitz and copy it to the root of your USB
Step 10. Extract the contents of xeunshacle into your USB root if it asks you to merger the badupdate folders merge them
Step 11.download Aurora extract the zip file and rename the folder that was extracted to Aurora
Step 12.now if you want inside the Aurora folder that we extracted make a games folder and since a regular xbox 360 game is usualy 6 to 7 Gb of storage and our usb because of FAT32 does not allow that big of a storage we use iso2god select add iso add ur rom for the xbox 360 select your Games folder (The Aurora folder must be copied to your USB for this) once iso selected it will ask you for a output select where ever just not on your usb and then hit convert.
The writing the game to the usb will be slow but be patient.
Step 13. Now using horizon which you can download [here](https://www.wemod.com/horizon) we can go inside the rock band blits folder(that we installed and extracted) keep entering the folder until you see a file with no extention on it with a bnch of random letters and numbers that is the important file that is our rock band blitz game drag it to horizon save to device an then your USB
Step 14.Now the fun begins boot ur xbox put your USB in go to games go into rockband blitz it will ask you for a storage device to save your files on but we wont be doing that when it asks you to select a storage device select your USB
Step 15.Now it will say running exploit then a video of chains breaking should be seen if yes you succesfuly softmodded your xbox 360 then a menu will pop up saying that sadly when the xbox is shut off it will return into its normal stte which means it wont be modded which means you will need to mod it using the rock band blitz again
Now we click the back button on the controller then in the games still we will open xex menu from there we will go into the aurora folder and open the aurora.xex file and congratulations you can now load games for free using the methood i just taought you
If this helped please leave a star it is free
